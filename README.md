# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## Introduction
This project creates a dashboard for Superstore, a well-known retailer in Canada now expanding into the USA. The dashboard is designed to help track how Sales Agents are performing in each state they are assigned to.

## Objective
The main goal of this dashboard is to provide the Sales Manager with a tool to compare sales performance across different timeframes and locations. It allows the manager to select specific periods (e.g., January - March 2020) and compare the data with the same period from the previous year to monitor growth.

## Key Features
- **Timeframe Selection**: Allows the Sales Manager to select specific timeframes this year and compare them with the same periods last year.
- **Sales Agent Performance**: Tracks sales by each Sales Agent in their respective states, providing a clear view of individual and state performance.
- **Category and Subcategory Breakdown**: Shows sales broken down by different product categories and subcategories.
- **Top Performing Products**: Identifies and lists the top-selling products to highlight successful items and trends.

## Project Goals
The dashboard is intended to give the Sales Manager a powerful tool to understand and enhance sales strategies based on detailed, actionable data. By comparing current sales to historical data, the manager can identify trends, make informed decisions, and drive growth more effectively.
